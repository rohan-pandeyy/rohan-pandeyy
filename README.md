### üåêAbout Me
I craft digital experiences with HTML, CSS and bring them to life with Vanilla Javascript. Additionally, I love building AI powered machines and robots that help ease out daily lives. Beyond code, I thrive in the tech community, sharing knowledge and innovating together. Play guitar, drums, and piano.
